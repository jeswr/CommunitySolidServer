 * Supports recursive deletes of containers, as requested with the `Depth: infinity` header.
 *
 * LWS, §Delete resource: "Servers MAY support recursive deletion of all contained resources
 * within the container that is being deleted. Clients MUST use the `Depth: infinity` header
 * to request for a recursive delete."
 *
 * The preconditions of the request are checked on the container first.
 * Then all contained resources are deleted, starting with the deepest ones,
 * after which the source handler deletes the container itself, without checking the preconditions again.
 * This is not atomic: if deleting a resource fails, the resources that were already deleted stay deleted.
